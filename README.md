----------- Stretch your thinking questions -----------

How do you think XML relates to HTML? 
What are some benefits of something like HTML using XML's syntax?  
What are some disadvantages?

-------------------------------------------------------

1. In W3schools it said that XML is often used complementary to HTML and that it is strictly used for moving data whereas HTML is used solely for data presentation. This makes sense why XML is so much more versatile where HTML has very structured elements.
2. Because the syntax is so similar it is easier to understand right out the gate. 

3. But for a beginner when creating the code it might also be more complicated because of it's similarities. I would assume with exposure to both languages it would be easier to differentiate between the two as well identify any issues that arise when writing the code.
